What has been implemented?

    In this program I extended HW4 to include extra functinoality. Instead of reading in order books from a file, you can generate virtual orderbooks using custom strategies and backtest to see how they perform.
    I have added 2 new directories: '.strategies/' and './strategies/indicators'
    Within these two folders is where you can add new indicators and strategies to the program

    Indicators:
    - indicators go in the indicators folder 
    - they may include parameters to tune them to their specific use cases
    - base package includes two indicators: RSI indicator and Bollinger Bands indicator

    Strategies:
    - strategies go in the strategies forlder 
    - strategies may also include parameters to tune them to their specific use cases
    - all strategies must extend the abstract_strategy.py class
    - strategies are used to create rules around indicator metrics and create buy and sell orders on the order book depending on those rules

    By backtesting a strategy-generated orderbook, you can see how your strategies perform with different stocks and tune them with new parameter strategies


What has not been implemented?

    Originally I planned to also to also include an optimizer that could maximize profit for a certain strategy for a specific time period and stock.
    I later learned that I could not use SciPy's optimizer solvers for this problem since it was a non-linear, mixed-integer optimization problem. (more explained in report and powepoint)
    the deprecated code is located in '.deprecated/minimizer.py'

    this code is not required to work for the project I am doing but more of a fun experiment. I figured I would leave it in the project directory rather than delete it.

Assumptions and limitations

    My assumptions include that that a stockholder is only buying and selling the same stock for each strategy iteration
    I also assume that the user is buying and selling the same amount of shares for each stock
    I'm also assuming that there are 252 trading days in a year while getting the portfolio stats and calculating the sharpe ratio.
    Lastly, I'm assuming that there is a market impact of 5% and that commission fees are a flat $9.95

    I am limited to only simple buy and sell orders, with trailing stop loss and take profit. My program cannot handle margin orders or trading options.
